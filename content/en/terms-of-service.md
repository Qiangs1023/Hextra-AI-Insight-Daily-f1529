# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into using our stuff, seriously, take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By just being here or using anything, you're basically saying "Yep, I agree!" to everything below.

## 1. Service Overview
The Site offers users a bunch of cool paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. Think blog posts, special resources, e-books, community interaction, and more! Just a heads-up, some content is only for our awesome subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   Users gotta provide a valid email and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy!
*   Users are totally on the hook for their account's security and everything that happens with it. And seriously, **no transferring or sharing accounts** – that's a big no-no.
*   The Site can, and will, **suspend or even terminate** a user's account if these terms get broken. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed monthly or yearly, and you'll see all the costs super clearly on the checkout page.
*   All payments go through third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal – we don't hold onto any of your payment deets here on the Site.
*   Subscriptions will **auto-renew**, so if you wanna bail, make sure to cancel before your current billing period ends.
*   Our **14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: If you're a first-timer and not digging our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email at the bottom of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up, though: it's one refund per user. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, payments are **non-refundable** unless the law says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. So, no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial stuff without our permission, okay?
*   Users only get **non-exclusive, non-transferable access rights** – strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
*   For commercial use or if you're planning on quoting a lot, please hit up the Site to get proper authorization first.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   It is absolutely **prohibited** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Just don't do it!
*   It is also **prohibited** to try and mass download, scrape, or crack our member content using any tech trickery. Seriously, don't even think about it.
*   The Site reserves the right to yank any inappropriate content and will definitely **ban users who violate** these rules. You've been warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We totally reserve the right to change, pause, or even stop any or all of our services whenever, without giving you a heads-up. Just how it goes sometimes!
*   The Site **won't be on the hook for any compensation** if content is temporarily unavailable because of things like acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service going down. Stuff happens, ya know?

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information the Site dishes out is just for kicks and reference, folks. It absolutely **does not count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.).
*   The Site **ain't responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services. Just a heads up!

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service? They're gonna be governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of California, USA – we're skipping all those tricky conflict of law principles.
*   Any disputes popping up from or tied to these terms? First, let's try to hash it out nicely. If that doesn't work, you're cool with bringing the matter to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Deal?
