# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we")! 🎉 Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our Site, you're agreeing to be bound by these terms – awesome!

## 1. Services Overview
**The Site** offers users paid subscription content and member services. This includes a bunch of cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
- **Your account's** security and all activities under it are your responsibility, so keep it safe! **Do NOT** transfer or share your account with anyone else. Seriously, don't.
- **We** reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you violate these terms. Just a heads-up!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, and all fees will be clearly displayed on the checkout page. No surprises!
- **All payments** are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe or PayPal), so don't worry – we don't store your payment info. Your security is key!
- **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Keep an eye on your dates! 📅
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet! If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally thrilled with our services, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just reach out to us via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not happy. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first subscription, payments are **non-refundable** unless legally required. Fair's fair!

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by hubtoday** (that's us!), and you can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission. No sneaky business!
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content for personal learning and reading. It's for you, not for resale!
- **For commercial use or extensive citation**, please get in touch with the Site to obtain authorization. We're usually pretty friendly!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Users are strictly prohibited from** uploading, posting, or distributing any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes upon others' rights. Let's keep things respectful, alright?
- **Bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking** member content through technical means is a strict **no-go**. Play fair!
- **The Site** reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. We're not messing around here. 🚫

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Think of it as evolving! 🚀
- **The Site** **won't be liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just go wrong, unfortunately.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided on the Site** is for reference only and **does NOT constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical). Please consult the pros for that!
- **The Site** **is absolutely not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, California law rules! ⚖️
- **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved amicably through negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's try to be friends first, though!
